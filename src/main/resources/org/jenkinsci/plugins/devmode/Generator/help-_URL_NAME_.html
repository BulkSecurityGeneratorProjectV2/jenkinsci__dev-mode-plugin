<div>
    Specify the portion of the Jenkins URL space that this extension occupies.
    There are a few different kind of values you can specify.

    <ul>
        <dt><b>"foo"</b>
        <dd>
        A simple token without '/' maps your object to ".../foo/" where "..."
        portion is the URL that points to the object that your action object attaches to.
        This is typically used for extensions that display information or forms.

        <dt><b>"/foo/bar"</b>
        <dd>
        A path that starts with '/' makes the action link to the specified path within Jenkins.
        This is typically used when your action simply refers to other parts of Jenkins.

        <dt><b>"http://jenkins-ci.org/somewhere"</b>
        <dd>
        Absolute URL makes the action link point to the specified URL. This is used when your
        action points to somewhere outside Jenkins.

        <dt><b>null</b>
        <dd>
        Specify null makes your action hidden from the HTTP requests. This is used when
        your action is just supposed to be accessed programmatically, as opposed by users.
    </ul>
